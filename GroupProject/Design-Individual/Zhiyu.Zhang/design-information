Benjamin Ng Assignment 5 Design Information:

1.As a user of the system I want to be able to see each store's offering and the amount of product in stock by square feet.
To realize this requirement, I used a FloorStore class with a listProducts() method to display all products and a getProductStock() method to show the stock quantity of a product.

2.The application must allow employees to add new products to the system. As well as delete and edit them.
To realize this requirement, I added a Employee class with addProduct(), editProduct(), and deleteProduct() method for managing products in the store.

3.Different categories of the floors: tile, stone, laminate, woodfloor, and vinyl.
To realize this requirement, I added a FloorCategory class representing the different categories of floors. The Floor class has a one-to-one relationship with the FloorCategory class.

4.The application must contain a database of the floors.
To realize this requirement, I added a Floor class with attributes such as productID, name, quantity, and price. This class would store floor products and their information.

5.Users must be able to search for products by picking from a hierarchical list, where the first level is the floor category, and the second level is the floor type.
To realize this requirement, I added a searchbyCategory method to Floor class that would allow users to search for a product based on their category in a hierachical list.

6.Users must also be able to specify an item by typing its name (search functionality).
To realize this, I added a searchbyName method to Floor class that would allow users to search for a product by their name.

7.All floors regardless of their category have an associated color, size, brand, type, and price.
To realize this requirement, I added a FloorAttributes class containing their size, color, brand, and price.

8.Categories tile and stone have different materials they are made of, e.g., Tile - porcelain, ceramic, resin; Stone - marble, pebble, slate.
To realize this requirement, I created subclasses of different materials such as tile and stone. Floor class has one-to-one relationship with FloorAttributes.

9.Wood floors have both a type (solid, engineered, bamboo, etc.) and species (oak, hickory, maple, etc.).
To realize this requirement, I added a the WoodFloor subclass from FloorType with type and species attribute.

10.Laminate can be regular laminate or water-resistant, whereas vinyl can be water-resistant or waterproof.
To realize this requirement, I added a laminate subclass from FloorType with a waterResistance attribute. The Vinyl subclass from FloorType contains a waterproof attribute.

11.The User Interface (UI) must be intuitive and responsive.
It's not considered at the moment because it doesn't affect the design directly.
