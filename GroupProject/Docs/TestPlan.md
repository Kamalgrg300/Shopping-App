Test Plan

Author: Kamal Gurung and Zhiyu Zhang

1 Testing Strategy
	Our testing strategy will involve a combination of unit, integration, system, and regression testing to ensure the FlooringIconManager app functions as intended and meets the requirements provided by FloorIcon Inc. The team will perform the testing activities in different phases of the development process.
In the testing strategy, We Team 2 will be following step by step process that has  four different sections. They are as follows.
Unit testing
Integration testing
System System
Acceptance testing



1.1 Overall strategy

As we are applying four different strategies in test plan, the application will be able to  run and it will also output the desired output. We"ll be perform updates and fix the bug if needed.

In the Unit testing, we"ll input test cases code manually that should get expected results at the end of testing.

In Integration testing, our Q&A tester and each design pages is tested where our program will be runnable, responsive and will also be able to provide smooth access to the user. Eg. create, reminder, search, delete and so on.

In System testing, we"ll test all the components of the developed application in android device or other compatible device.

In Regression testing, our developer teams will work in the updates, bug fix and develop codes if needed which will not affect the application before deployment.
Acceptance testing: we will be testing the correct input acceptance and delivering the required output as excepted in the acceptance testing. 



1.2 Test Selection

	We will employ both black-box and white-box testing techniques to select test cases. For unit testing, we will focus on white-box testing to cover individual components and their interactions. In contrast, for integration and system testing, we will use black-box testing techniques, focusing on the application's functionality from the user's perspective.

We”ll be performing both blackbox and whitebox techniques as well as we”ll the be performing the testing manually for each test cases.

Each code will be tested while using whitebox techniques.
The functionality of the application, responsiveness, bug fix, updates and valid inputs and errors will be checked while performing blackbox technique.

1.3 Adequacy Criterion
	
	For unit testing, we will aim for high code coverage (e.g., statement, branch, and condition coverage). For integration and system testing, we will focus on functional coverage, ensuring that all major user scenarios and application functionalities are tested.

As our developing and designing work finish in the structural coverage, we will be focusing in functional coverage as equally as structural coverage because our goal is to have a well developed application that can function and execute properly. 
In Unit testing, we will perform test in each function of the application if it runs and execute properly.
In System testing, we will perform test as a group to check the developed program to meet the desired requirements.



1.4 Bug Tracking

We will using the GitHub platform from where everyone in our team 2 will be able to see changes, commits, updates, and required changes if needed in Bug tracking.
Also, we will be using the discord for quick updates in real time.


1.5 Technology

	To facilitate our testing process, we will utilize testing technologies such as JUnit for unit testing, Espresso for Android UI testing, and Selenium for end-to-end testing.

As we have completed the Assignment 4 (Tip calculator), we will be using the same testing technology.
We will be using JUNIT platform for testing technology. We will manually carry out the test cases after the design and code development is finished.
We will be working in Java Programming Language as our developer team is comfortable working in Java.
We will be using Android studio application to carry out manual testing.

TEST PLAN For After the app is made
Author: Kamal Gurung and Zhiyu Zhang
We the Team 2, worked on building an INVENTORY APPLICATION that allows customers to do shopping as well as the employees to restock the materials. Since Test plan has several testing strategies, it involves a combination of testing processes. Since team 2 successfully performed the testing activities in different phases of the development process. As we executed the test plan, the application is able to run and outputs the desired output. We performed updates, fixed the bug towards the development of the application. 
1.	TESTING STRATEGY:
In the testing strategy, We Team 2 have worked on four different levels of testing. They are as follows. 
- Unit testing 
-Integration testing 
-System testing
- Regression testing:
-Acceptance testing

Unit testing: We input test cases code manually to get expected results at the end of testing. Such as adding the items manually. we successfully completed the full code coverage in statement, branch, and condition coverage). For integration and system testing, we will focus on functional coverage, ensuring that all major user scenarios and application functionalities are tested. 

Integration testing:  Each design pages is tested, and it works perfectly runnable and responsive. We are able to deliver smooth access to the user. E.g. create, reminder, search, delete, add and so on.

System testing: We tested all the components of our developed application in android device. It works perfectly. Also, we ran in Emulator which the application has no defects while running. We are able to meet the goal to make an inventory app.
Regression testing: Since our developer team have worked on the updates, bug fix and develop codes. We have come up with the ideas and implementing the bug fix, fixing app crash.

 Acceptance testing: we have tested the app with providing the correct input acceptance and we succussed in delivering the required output as accepted in the acceptance testing.




2.	Test Selection (Black box /White box) Testing
We have implemented both black-box and white-box testing techniques to select test cases. For unit testing, we have focused on white box testing that covers individual components and their interactions. In contrast, for integration and system testing, we have used black box testing techniques that help us to focus on the application's functionality from the user's perspective. The main functionality of the application is responsiveness, bug fix, updates and valid inputs and errors will be checked while performing Blackbox technique.
3.	(Structural / Functional) Coverage
We focused on Functional Coverage as equally as Structural Coverage, we have a well-developed application that can function and execute properly. In Unit testing, we performed many tests in each function of the application to see if it runs and executes properly. In System testing, we performed the test as a group to check the developed program.
4.	Technology Use and Bug Fix
We used GitHub to develop the code, see changes, commits, updates, Bug tracking and helping out each team member from the development to the deployment. Similarly, we used JUNIT platform for testing technology, Espresso for Android UI testing, and Selenium for end-to-end testing. We carried out manual test cases after the design and code development is finished. Our program uses Java Programming Language in Android studio application for the whole group project.
