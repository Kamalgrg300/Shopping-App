A. Designs:
Jesrhythm Kaur: It is straightforward. The design is Robust. It includes cart functionality.It includes the User Id which was not a requirement in the instructions.Missing the employee information
Benjamin Ng: It has all the basic requirements. It has all the subclasses. Floor and floor attributes are separated which is good. User method is missing.
Kamal Gurung:There is a subclass of Wood Species which has the species listed. Some of the UML design does not  have the string, float written(Just a little technical thing). There is a hierarchical list and product list which means that the product list has all the products and the hierarchical list connects Product names, categories and types. There are also relationships which have descriptions that helps the design talk to us.
Daniel Culbert: There is an employee method which is good. I like how there is a method which can find by name and find by hierarchy. He created a linkedlist which is good. One of the con is that he is missing a Type box. Meets the demands of the requirements.
Zhiyu Zhang: Instead of subclasses all the types are put into the Floor category which does not overcomplicate the design. But then at the same time its needed that this design was separated as well. The Floor has the water resistant part which is good. There are two product categories which are unnecessary. It looks like its a chain of stores. 
Abdul Mohammed: Very detailed it has amountBySquareFeet attribute. Its a simple design but it has everything. Employee section is missing the name. Floor should have a floor id to distinguish the products. Maybe the search by hierarchy should be in the product section. Missing the water resistant and waterproof part.

B.
During the aggregation process, we considered the robustness of Jesrhythm Kaur's design, the clear separation of floor attributes in Benjamin Ng's design, the hierarchical list and product list in Kamal Gurung's design, the employee method and linked list in Daniel Culbert's design, the simplicity and chain of stores aspect in Zhiyu Zhang's design, and the detail and simplicity of Abdul Mohammed's design.

Our Team Design incorporates the best elements from each individual design. We added a "FloorStore" class to represent the chain of stores and an "Employee" class to manage employee information. We ensured that the UML diagram addressed all the requirements, including the missing water-resistant and waterproof attributes, the floor types, and the employee information.

C. 
By evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each member's design, we gained insights into different approaches and perspectives, which ultimately enhanced our collective understanding of the problem.

By respecting and valuing each team member's input, we were able to create an inclusive environment that fostered collaboration and allowed us to combine our strengths effectively. We learned that being open to different perspectives and constructive criticism can lead to a better design and product for our future collaborations. 

Overall, this collaborative design process taught us the significance of teamwork, open-mindedness, and effective communication in team-oriented projects.
